# The Periodic Table of Elements

## Introduction

The Periodic Table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements organized by their **atomic number**, **electron configuration**, and **recurring chemical properties**.

## History

- **1869**: Dmitri Mendeleev published the first widely recognized periodic table
- Arranged elements by atomic mass and properties
- Left gaps for undiscovered elements and predicted their properties
- **Modern Table**: Organized by atomic number (Henry Moseley, 1913)

## Structure of the Periodic Table

### Basic Organization

```
Periods (Rows): 7 horizontal rows
Groups (Columns): 18 vertical columns
```

### Key Sections

1. **Main Group Elements** (Groups 1, 2, 13-18)
2. **Transition Metals** (Groups 3-12)
3. **Inner Transition Metals** (Lanthanides & Actinides)

---

## Groups (Vertical Columns)

Elements in the same group have **similar chemical properties** due to the same number of valence electrons.

### Important Groups

| Group | Name | Valence e⁻ | Properties |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|
| **1** | Alkali Metals | 1 | Highly reactive, soft metals |
| **2** | Alkaline Earth Metals | 2 | Reactive metals, harder than Group 1 |
| **17** | Halogens | 7 | Highly reactive non-metals |
| **18** | Noble Gases | 8 | Inert, stable, unreactive |

### Group 1: Alkali Metals

**Elements**: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr

**Properties**:
- Soft, shiny metals
- Low density (Li, Na, K float on water!)
- Very reactive with water: 2Na + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂↑
- React with oxygen: 4Na + O₂ → 2Na₂O
- Reactivity **increases** down the group

### Group 17: Halogens

**Elements**: F, Cl, Br, I, At

**Properties**:
- Exist as diatomic molecules (F₂, Cl₂, Br₂, I₂)
- Highly reactive non-metals
- Form salts with metals (NaCl, KBr)
- Reactivity **decreases** down the group
- States: F₂, Cl₂ (gas), Br₂ (liquid), I₂ (solid)

### Group 18: Noble Gases

**Elements**: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn

**Properties**:
- Complete valence shell (stable octet, except He has 2)
- Extremely unreactive (inert)
- Colorless, odorless gases
- Used in lighting (neon signs), balloons (helium), welding (argon)

---

## Periods (Horizontal Rows)

Elements in the same period have the **same number of electron shells**.

### Periodic Properties

| Period | Shells | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 | 1 shell | H, He |
| 2 | 2 shells | Li to Ne |
| 3 | 3 shells | Na to Ar |
| 4 | 4 shells | K to Kr |

## Periodic Trends

### 1. Atomic Radius

**Definition**: Distance from nucleus to outermost electron

**Trends**:
- ⬇️ **Decreases** across a period (left to right)
  - Reason: Increased nuclear charge pulls electrons closer
- ⬆️ **Increases** down a group
  - Reason: Additional electron shells

```
Largest: Fr (bottom-left)
Smallest: He (top-right)
```

### 2. Ionization Energy

**Definition**: Energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom

**Trends**:
- ⬆️ **Increases** across a period
  - Reason: Stronger nuclear attraction
- ⬇️ **Decreases** down a group
  - Reason: Electrons farther from nucleus, easier to remove

```
Highest: He, Ne, Ar (noble gases)
Lowest: Fr, Cs (alkali metals)
```

### 3. Electronegativity

**Definition**: Ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons

**Trends**:
- ⬆️ **Increases** across a period
- ⬇️ **Decreases** down a group

```
Most electronegative: F (fluorine) = 4.0
Least electronegative: Cs, Fr
```

### 4. Metallic Character

**Trends**:
- ⬇️ **Decreases** across a period
- ⬆️ **Increases** down a group

```
Most metallic: Fr (bottom-left)
Most non-metallic: F (top-right)
```

## Categories of Elements

### 1. Metals (Left side & center)

**Properties**:
- Shiny (lustrous)
- Good conductors of heat and electricity
- Malleable (can be hammered into sheets)
- Ductile (can be drawn into wires)
- Form positive ions (cations)

### 2. Non-Metals (Right side)

**Properties**:
- Dull appearance
- Poor conductors (insulators)
- Brittle in solid state
- Form negative ions (anions)
- Examples: C, N, O, P, S, Cl

### 3. Metalloids (Staircase line)

**Elements**: B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te

**Properties**:
- Properties intermediate between metals and non-metals
- Semiconductors (Si used in computer chips)
- Used in electronics

## Valency

**Definition**: Combining capacity of an element

### Trends Across Period 2

| Element | Li | Be | B | C | N | O | F | Ne |
|---------|----|----|---|---|---|---|---|-----|
| Valency | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |

**Pattern**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0

---

## Important Facts

✅ **Atomic Number** = Number of protons = Number of electrons (in neutral atom)

✅ **Mass Number** = Protons + Neutrons

✅ **Isotopes**: Same atomic number, different mass numbers (e.g., C-12, C-14)

✅ **Modern Periodic Law**: Properties are periodic functions of atomic number

✅ **Diagonal Relationship**: Elements diagonally adjacent show similar properties (Li-Mg, Be-Al)

## Solved Examples

### Example 1

**Q**: Element X has 17 electrons. Identify its group and period.

**Solution**:
```
Electronic configuration: 2, 8, 7
- Shells = 3 → Period 3
- Valence electrons = 7 → Group 17
```

**Answer**: Period 3, Group 17 (Chlorine)

### Example 2

**Q**: Arrange F, Cl, Br in order of increasing atomic radius.

**Solution**:
```
All are in Group 17
Down the group: atomic radius increases
```

**Answer**: F < Cl < Br

### Example 3

**Q**: Which has higher ionization energy: Na or Mg?

**Solution**:
```
Both in Period 3
Mg is to the right of Na
Across period: ionization energy increases
```

**Answer**: Mg has higher ionization energy

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Why is the periodic table called "periodic"?**

**A**: Because properties repeat at regular intervals (periodically) when elements are arranged by atomic number.

**Q2: Why are noble gases unreactive?**

**A**: They have a complete valence shell (octet configuration), making them stable.

**Q3: What is the significance of Mendeleev's gaps?**

**A**: He correctly predicted properties of undiscovered elements like Ga, Ge, and Sc.
